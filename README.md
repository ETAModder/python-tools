**DISCLAIMER**: all the password cracking and other tools that could be harmful are all fake and purely visual.

- eWEB: *really bad web browser thing that loads contents of a page and has a box that loads images.*
- eCRYPT: *encrypt and decrypt files using .etacrypt and another one i forgot.*
- pCRACK: *purely visual 'password cracker' that generates random fake ips and 'cracks' passwords that don't exist.*
- pHELPER: *generates secure passwords with length and content settings.*
- hGEN: *hashing tool with many hashes and salting.*

some of them look good some don't usually because i was lazy while writing them.
